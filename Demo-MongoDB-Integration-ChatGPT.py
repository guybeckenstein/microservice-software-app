Example by ChatGPT. Description:
Configure MongoDB Connection in Microservices: In each of your Flask microservices (Meals and Diets),
you need to configure the connection to the MongoDB database.
Here's an example of how you can configure it using the pymongo library:
"""

app = Flask(__name__)
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017')
db = client['your_database_name']


@app.route('/meals', methods=['GET'])
def get_meals():
    # Access the MongoDB database and perform operations
    collection = db['your_collection_name']
    # Perform queries, updates, or other operations using the collection object
    pass


# Additional routes and code for the Meals microservice
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001)
